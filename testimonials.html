Our current market is research and education but we will soon address the customer market. For this very demanding market, the dependability and the reliability are crucial. Within the Romeo 2 project, Aldebaran collaborates with CEA LIST to build the model of its humanoid robots in UML (and its extension to robotics, RobotML) with Papyrus. Papyrus made very easy the modelling of Romeo with its 37 actuators, more than 100 sensors, the 4 embedded processors and the 40 microcontrollers of its distributed architecture. This modelling will be the first step of the safety analysis that we have to proceed before designing the robots we will deliver to customers.</p>

                    <p class="text-justify"><b>SPACEBEL detailed usage of Papyrus</b>: As sub-contractor of CNES, Spacebel works with Papyrus in the frame of the TARANIS mission. The general objective of the TARANIS mission is to analyse radiations from lightning and sprites in magnetosphere-ionosphere-atmosphere. Spacebel is in charge of the development of the On-Board Software (OBSW) of the satellite main payload. About the OBSW functionalities, it is mainly in charge of the handling, monitoring and the processing of the scientific data to be transmitted to the central data handling of the spacecraft. In other words, the software manages the main scientific instrument of the spacecraft. In the frame of this development, Papyrus is used as the UML modeler for the architecture and development of the OBSW. Taking the advantage of UML and Papyrus, the complete specification of the software is implemented in UML through Papyrus. Then, the architectural elements can easily be traced with their requirements. For instance, an operation (functionality) can be linked to a constraint (requirement). In doing so, the architectural design can be deduced from the specification by populating classes with operations, attributes, data types, etc. Besides UML, Spacebel has developed an extension to Papyrus. Since the target language of the software is the ANSI C, the semantic of UML didn’t permit us to map the C semantic in UML. Therefore, a functional C profile and several stereotypes have been developed aside of the project. The profile is actually enclosed in an Eclipse plugin and fully integrated with Papyrus. Finally, at the end of the chain, Spacebel generates all the C sources with the help of a C code generator. A text transformation is performed from UML to C. Furthermore, the documentation (software requirement document and architectural design document) is also generated from UML.

In one hand, several student projects consist in modeling embedded systems with Papyrus (e.g., modeling an indoor UAV with autonomous guidance for performance estimation using SysML). In the other hand, one of the mean research topic of the school is optimization of system parameters such as cost and reliability, combining MBSE and CSP problem solving paradigms. The proposed solution is then implemented as a Papyrus extension using its various powerful customization mechanisms (e.g., DSML support).

                    <p class="text-justify"><b>About</b>: Patrick Leserf, born in 1969, received an engineering degree in computer science/electronic from ESEO (1993, Angers). He started to work for 10 years as R&amp;D engineer and project leader in telecommunication industry (3G testing at Acterna). Mr Leserf was the technical coordinator of the PCRD “Matelo” project at ALL4TEC. Then he joined ESTACA, as associate professor. His research works concerns the model-based design of distributed real-time systems, and embedded networks for transportation. Mr Leserf was in charge of “O4A” (Open for Autosar) national collaborative project at ESTACA, integrating and demonstrating the Flexray network in Autosar. Mr Leserf is now working on the optimization of embedded system design with MBSE, in collaboration with the ISAE-DISC team at Toulouse.
